TASK_DESC_TEMPORAL = "The current task is an event temporal relation extraction task, which aims to" \
                     " identify temporal relations among events in texts. The temporal relation " \
                     "between events refers to the chronological order in which they occur, " \
                     "involving three subtypes, namely, VAGUE, EQUAL, and BEFORE. In the provided document, " \
                     "event trigger words are annotated within angle brackets (<>). The desired outcome is " \
                     "a list of events in the document that have temporal relations with the given event. " \
                     "The prescribed output format should follow this structure: " \
                     "'relation1: event1, event2; relation2: event3, event4'. The output 'relation: none' " \
                     "indicates that the given event lacks this particular type of relation with other events."
